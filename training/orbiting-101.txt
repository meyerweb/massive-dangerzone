This training scenario covers the basics of flying a spacecraft in orbit: Essential maneuvers like raising and lowering apoapsis and periapsis nodes, and also important concepts, such as what the terms "apoapsis" and "periapsis" mean. You'll start off in a low circular orbit around Kerbin, with the Orbiter 1 training craft ready to go.

Orbiting 101

Welcome to the Orbiting 101 training program!  I'm Gene Kerman, and I'm going to teach you the basics of orbiting.

I assume you've already done the basic flight tutorials, and are now ready to learn how to get around in space.  If you haven't done them, well, I hope you know what you're doing.

Let's get started.

Orbiting 101 - Basics

Orbiting is really nothing more than free-falling.  The only thing is that as you fall, you're moving so fast forward, you actually miss the ground.  Because up here there is no atmosphere to slow you down, you will continue to free-fall endlessly around the planet, without having to use your engines.

We are currently on a low, almost circular orbit around Kerbin.  To get a better view of your situation, press the [M] key to go into the Map View.

--

Orbiting 101 - The Map View

This is the Map View.  Here you can see your ship's position and its current trajectory around the planet.

Use the mouse to look around, to see your orbit from various angles.  Also, hovering over the icons on the map will display more information about them.

Close the map when you're ready (press the [M] key again), so we can proceed.

--

Orbiting 101 - Attitude and SAS

Good, let's get practical now.  I trust you already know your basic spacecraft controls.  Up here, they're very much the same, only the lack of an atmosphere makes the ship behave quite a bit differently.  Because there is no drag slowing you down, for every input you apply, you'll have to apply an opposite one to come to a stop again.

I'm going to remotely nudge your attitude controls a little.  Try to get the ship back under control afterwards.

If you find yourself totally out of control, hit [T] to toggle the SAS on.

Are you ready?

--

Orbiting 101 - Attitude and SAS

OK, here we go...

--

Orbiting 101 - Attitude and SAS

There!  You're in control now.  Stop rotation using the Pitch, Yaw, and Roll controls.

I suggest you use the NavBall to orient yourself, instead of looking at the ship.  The NavBall isn't affected by the camera rotation, so it should be easier to get your bearings through it than by looking at the outside.

--

Orbiting 101 - Attitude and SAS

Nicely Done!

Attitude control is an essential skill for a spacecraft piot.  Master it, and you'll be well on your way to becoming an expert commander.

You can try this again if you want, or press Next if you're ready to move on.

--

Orbiting 101 - The NavBall

OK, now let's have a look at the NavBall.  You've probably seen the symbols on it when you were spinning around.

Here's what they mean:

Prograde Vector: It points towards you velocity vector.  That is, it points to where you're going.

Retrograde Vector: It points directly away from your velocity.

Prograde Waypoint Vector: It points towards your current Waypoint.

Retrograde Waypoint Vector: It points directly away from your current Waypoint.

--

Orbiting 101

OK!

Now, let's try something a little more involved.  Open your map again.

--

Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers

What we want to do now is go through some of the basic maneuvers you'll need to know.  Let's try raising your Apoapsis first.

The Apoapsis is the highest point in an orbit, and it's indicated by the node marked [Ap].

The best place to raise your apoapsis is at the Periapsis [Pe] node, which is the lowest point of your orbit.  If you hover the mouse over Periapsis node, you'll see that we are going to reach it in a few minutes.  Once there, we will face prograde and burn.

Press [Period] to speed up time a little, so we can get there faster.

--

Orbiting 101 - Time Warp

OK, time is now passing 5 times faster than normal, we should be there in a few moments.

You can control time warp with the [Period] and [Comma] keys, or click the arrows on the panel on the top left of the screen.

This time, I'll put us back to normal just before we reach periapsis.

Out of training, though, you'll have to warp time down to 1x yourself, so don't go too fast or you might miss your mark.

--

Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers

OK, we are a few seconds away from Periapsis now.  Time to turn prograde and do our burn.

However, instead of closing the map, let's just bring up the NavBall here, so we can see what's happening to our orbit as we accelerate.

To bring up the NavBall on the Map, click the little tab on the bottom-center of the screen, or press the numpad [Period] key.

--

Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers

Good.  Time to do our burn.  Turn the ship to face the Prograde Vector now.

Turn SAS on if you need help maintaining stability.

Remember, the prograde vector looks like this:

Make sure the ship is pointing towards it before accelerating.

--

Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers

OK, we are now turned prograde.  I've engaged SAS for you to keep her steady.  Press the [Z] key to accelerate at full throttle.

--

Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers

Notice how the opposite side of your orbit starts to rise as you accelerate.

Keep thrusting prograde until your apoapsis altitude reaches about 800,000m.

--

Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers

OK, cut the throttle now!

Hold [LeftControl] or hit [X] to cut throttle immediately.

--

Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers

Well done!

This is how you raise your Apoapsis node.

With orbital maneuvers, pretty much everything you do will affect the opposite side of your orbit.  So to raise the highest point (Apoapsis), you thrust forward (or prograde) at the lowest point (Periapsis).  Similarly, to raise your Periapsis, you thrust prograde at Apoapsis.  We're on our way to the Apoapsis now, so let's do just that.

Press Next when ready, and I'll warp time to get us there quickly.

--

Orbiting 101 - Essential Maneuvers

OK, we're on our way to the Apoapsis node now.  Notice how your ship loses speed as we rise.  That's because we're climbing away from the planet, so we lose speed as we go higher, just as you would if you were climbing a hill back here on Kerbin.

The higher you are, the slower your orbit will be.  Notice how the Mun's orbital speed is around 540m/s, while yours is far higher.

When we reach Apoapsis, we will burn prograde again, to raise the Periapsis node and circularize our orbit.

--

Orbiting 101 - Raise Periapsis

OK, Here we are...same as before, turn prograde and fire up those engines, and watch the Periapsis rise.

Mind that we are probably turned the other way right now, so the Prograde Vector might not be visible.

Prograde Vector:

--

Orbiting 101 - Raise Periapsis

Keep burning prograde until the orbit is nearly circular...

--

Orbiting 101 - Raise Periapsis

Nicely done!

This is how you change the size of your orbit.  This maneuver should come in handy in many situations.

Next, we'll look into changing your orbital inclination.

Press Next when ready to proceed.

--

Orbiting 101 - Raise Periapsis

Your orbital inclination is the angle your orbit makes to Kerbin's Equator.  If you've managed to maintain a reasonable amount of control this far, we should still be in a nearly 0º inclination orbit.  That is, even though we've changed the altitude of our orbit, it still has the same inclination as before.

Changing inclination is done by thrusting in 90º angles to your prograde vector, but without changing your pitch relative to the surface.

On our present, nearly equatorial orbit, prograde is due east.  That means to increase our inclination, so that our orbit takes us into higher latitudes, we have to burn towards the North.

--

Orbiting 101 - Normal Vectors

If everything I just said made your head spin, the NavBall once again comes to your rescue.  To change your orbital inclination you can use the Normal Vectors:

Normal Vector: It is perpendicular to the Orbital Plane.  It points in the positive, or "upwards" direction.

Anti Normal Vector: It is perpendicular to the Orbital Plane.  It points in the negative, or "downwards" direction.

In this case you will need to use the Normal Vector.

Let's try that now: Turn the ship to the Normal Vector's direction and open the throttle.

--

Orbiting 101 - Inclination

Notice how as you burn north, your orbit starts to tilt up, but the Periapsis and Apoapsis nodes remain mostly the same.

That is because we are accelerating in a completely new direction, so this maneuver doesn't add or take away any energy from the orbit.

Keep accelerating north until your inclination is about 10º.

--

Orbiting 101 - Inclination

Good!  This is how you change your orbital inclination.

For these maneuvers, it's always better to do it in the slowest parts of the orbit, so you don't have to spend as much delta-V to turn your orbit around.  That also means inclination changes on larger orbits, such as we are on now, take less fuel than the same inclination change on a lower one.

Also, keep in mind that changing inclination doesn't necessarily mean accelerating to the north or south.  It means accelerating on 90º headings to your prograde vector - which, on our nearly equatorial orbit, also happened to be towards the north.

Next, let's look into the last essential maneuver you'll need to learn: Lowering our orbit.

--

Orbiting 101 - Lower Periapsis

As you can imagine, lowering your orbit's altitude is very much like raising it, only in reverse.

Because there's no air up here, we can use our main engines to decelerate as well as accelerate, because nothing says we have to be facing some direction or other.

Also, since our orbit is nearly circular, we can just turn retrograde and do our burn at any time now, so let's get to it.

Turn towards the Retrograde Vector and start those engines up again.

Retrograde Vector:

--

Orbiting 101 - Lower Periapsis

Keep burning retrograde until the Periapsis altitude is around 30,000m.

Try getting it as close as possible this time.  If you overshoot and get it too low, turn prograde and accelerate again.  For precision, remember that you can modulate your throttle using using the [LeftControl] and [LeftShift] keys.

--

Orbiting 101 - Lower Periapsis

That's it!  You're now on your way back.

30,000m is low enough to be in the atmosphere, so you are now on a re-entry course to Kerbin.  Once we're below 60,000m, the atmosphere will start slowing the ship down, so that it won't have enough velocity to rise back up again.

--

Orbiting 101 - Complete!

This is the end of our lesson now.  You can continue doing maneuvers on your own, or wait for periapsis and do a reentry and land.  Don't forget to decouple the capsule and deploy the parachutes.

See you on the ground!
