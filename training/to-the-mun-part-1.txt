This tutorial will introduce you to flights outside of Kerbin's sphere of influence, at the most basic level - flying to the Mun.

To The Mun: Part 1

Welcome to the first in a series of scenarios designed to prepare you for flight in and around Kerbin's local system.  I'm going to assume you've completed both the Flight Basics tutorial as well as Orbiting 101.  If not, you should go do them.

When you're ready to go, hit Continue.

Transfer Orbits

The bread and butter of flights between celestial objects is a Transfer Orbit, which basically means an orbit used to transfer between two orbits.  In our case, the periapsis of our orbit will be very near to Kerbin, and the Apoapsis will extend to just beyond the Mun's orbit.  The same applies to an interplanetary trajectory, just on a much larger scale.

Now, press the [M] key to go into the Map View, so we can get an overview of Kerbin's local system.

Transfer Orbits

To perform a successful transfer, it needs to take the same amount of time for both you and your target object to reach the same location.

If you really know what you're doing, you can calculate your own transfer orbit on the fly, or you could try eyeballing it, but it's better to play it safe and use Maneuver Nodes, so let's go ahead and create a Maneuver Node.  Click anywhere on your orbit and click the Add Maneuver button.

Maneuver Nodes

Maneuver nodes let you plan orbital maneuvers ahead of time, and most importantly, without wasting precious fuel.  As you can see, maneuver nodes have six handles: the green ones are Prograde and Retrograde, the purple ones are Normal and Antinormal, and the blue ones are Radial and Antiradial.  I'm not going to go into details because these are the same vectors on the NavBall you saw in the Orbiting tutorial.  Just remember that Prograde and Retrograde help you grow or shrink your orbit, and Normal and Antinormal help you tilt it.

Maneuver Nodes

You can click and drag the different handles to see an effect in your theoretical orbit by affecting the vector in question.  In our particular case, we're going to bring the orbit's Apoapsis up just enough to intercept the Mun's orbit at around 45 degrees ahead of it.  If your trajectory is correct, the orbit line will shift colors, representing a change in which celestial body's gravity is holding onto you when you reach that point.

Maneuver Nodes

Let's get to it then, drag your maneuver node to the orbit's Periapsis.  To do this, click and drag the center.  Once there, pull the Prograde handle until you see a satisfactory theoretical orbit - it has to be an intercept trajectory to the Mun, though.  If you want to start over, you can delete the maneuver node and create a new one.  Right click it while it's open to show the close button.

Orbital Insertion

There we go!  Your theoretical orbit is now on an intercept trajectory, headed right for the Mun.

There are a few things to notice now.  Bring out your NavBall; you will see a few things that weren't there before the maneuver node.  The bar on the right is the velocity change (delta-V for short) required to make your theoretical orbit the actual one.  You will also see the approximated burn time needed to deplete the bar, and how long it will take to reach the maneuver.  For now we will do just that, but wait until we're closer to the maneuver.

Maneuver Execution

We're getting close to maneuver time!  There is one final step to take before executing it: you will now see an additional blue icon in your NavBall.  That indicates where you have to be pointing in order to perform the maneuver successfully.  If the marker is not visible, then you will see a small arrow indicating its general direction instead.

I'll give you an expert tip: start your burn when the time-to-maneuver-node indicator is half the time the maneuver takes.  For example, if your approximated burn is 20 seconds, start burning 10 seconds before you get there.  This is not mandatory, but it's more efficient.  I'll leave it at your discretion, but since this is quite a long burn, I suggest you start ASAP.

Maneuver Execution

Good work, recruit!  You may have noticed your actual orbit is not exactly the one you had planned.  This is because the ship's computer calculates an ideal orbit that is very hard to get in practice, but close enough is good enough.  You can fine tune it a bit by burning a bit more, but be careful not to overdo it.  I'll leave a reset button there in case you screw it up.  Now we'll wait for you to be sucked in by the Mun's gravity.

--

Orbital Insertion

You now are gravitationally bound to the Mun.  Currently, you're on an escape trajectory relative to it, so wait until periapsis, and then burn retrograde to slow yourself down enough to be captured into an orbit.  I recommend you use a maneuver node in the Periapsis once again.  If your orbit doesn't have a periapsis you can correct it - create a maneuver node and pull either blue (Radial or Antiradial) handle to get the Periapsis where you want it.

If you make a mistake, hit the Reset button.

Orbital Insertion

Now that you're not on an escape trajectory, try to get yourself into a circular orbit below at least 200,000m.

Remember, you can use yet another maneuver node.

Tutorial complete!

Good work!  You're now in orbit around the Mun with a ship fully capable of landing on it, if you're feeling up to the challenge - which I encourage you to do, because in the next tutorial, we'll cover the full procedure of getting back to Kerbin from a ship landed on the Mun.  I'll just give you a tip for the landing: remember that there is no atmosphere here, so a parachute will be less than useless.  You'll have to use your boosters.  Okay, good luck with that, I'm running late for lunch.
