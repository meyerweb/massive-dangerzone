massive-dangerzone
==================

The text in Kerbal Space Program tutorial and scenario dialogs, with grammar and spelling errors corrected.  I’m undertaking this as a volunteer effort with Squad’s approval.

ALL CONTENT IN THIS REPOSITORY (except this readme) IS COPYRIGHT SQUAD, the makers of Kerbal Space Program.  Any changes made in this repository that go into KSP WILL BECOME PROPERTY OF SQUAD, with no promise or implication that there will be any form of compensation or even recognition.  Any pull requests or other contributions are considered to constitute agreement with and acceptance of these terms.  Just so we’re clear.

### Commit strategy

As much as possible, I tried to make a file’s first commit be an exact copy of the text that’s in the game as it stands.  (I made a few goofs.)  Then I committed corrections as I made them.  Thus, with any luck, running a diff of a file’s first and last commits should show which dialogs need correction, and what those corrections are.

### Massive Dangerzone?

The repository name is what GitHub suggested as a default, and it was just too perfect a fit to pass up.
